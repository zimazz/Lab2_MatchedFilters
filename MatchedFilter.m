function [rec_bits, ht, z_signal] = MatchedFilter(T_sq,E_bit,fs,y_signal,type)
%
% Inputs:
%   T_sq_dur:   Duration of the square pulse in seconds
%   E_bit:      Total energy in all samples of one square pulse
%   fs:         Sampling frequency
%   y_square:   Sequence of samples which correspond to the square pulses
%               of the input bits to be detected
%   type:       Type of bit coding, 'unipolar' or 'bipolar' (default is 
%               'unipolar')
% Outputs:
%   rec_bits:   The sequence of bits decoded by the matched filter
%               corresponding to the input y_square
%   ht:         The impulse response of the matched filter
%   z_square:   The output of the convolution operation between the input
%               sequence y_square and the impulse response h_t
%
% This function implements the matched fiilter receiver for a square pulse
% shape. The function takes as input y_square, which contains the samples
% corresponding to the sequence of square pulse shapes of the input bits.
% The operation of the function is the matched filter operation:
%
%         1- It generates ht, the impulse response of the appropriate
%         matched filter
%         2- It performs a convolution operation between ht and the input
%         sequence y_square. The output of this operation is stored in a
%         variable called z_square
%         3- From the variable z_square, the function makes a decision on
%         the value of each input bit.
%
% Notes and hints: 
%       - The dimensions of ht should be equal to N_sq, which is the length
%       of the square pulse used in the generation of the input sequence.
%       - The dimensions of z_square should be equal to the expected length
%       of the output of a convolution operation between two input
%       sequences: y_square and ht.
%       - From z_square (which should be a long vector, longer than the
%       expected number of input bits), the function should decide the
%       value of each input bit and store those in the variable rec_bits.
%       Note therefore that rec_bits should have a smaller length than
%       z_square.
%       - If type is not specified, it is assumed to be 'RZ'.
